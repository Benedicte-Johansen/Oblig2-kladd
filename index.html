      <h3> Scully in the zone </h3>
  <img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firstperson1.jpg" alt="Scully's in the zone! Battling a killer 
  avatar in the episode from the episode called First Person Shooter from season 7">
  <p>Likewise, there are several MOW episodes that are worthy of honorable mention. Who could forget Zelijko Ivanek's incredible 
    performance as a mentally disabled janitor for a science lab in "Roland" (S1)? Tony Shalhoub was equally terrific as a physicist 
    haunted by his own shadow in "Soft Light" (S2), despite the nonsensical physics. "All Souls" (S5) showcased Scully struggling 
    with grief over the loss of her daughter, while "Elegy" (S4) and "Tithonus" (S6) continued Scully's emotional arc concerning 
    her faith and human mortality.

    It's equally tough to forget the disturbing "Home" (S4), which featured a squicky incest-centric plot that warranted the show's 
    first TV-MA rating. The concept of a meteorologist whose repressed emotions affect the weather made "The Rain King" (S6) 
    stand out, while the heist caper of S7's "The Amazing Maleeni," featuring real-world magician Ricky Jay, was a refreshing change 
    of pace from the show's usual fare. The S7 satirical episode "Hollywood A.D." (penned by Duchovny) also provided a playful 
    respite, though it was marred by a rather silly subplot. And who could forget the William Gibson-penned "First Person Shooter" 
    (S7), in which Mulder and Scully suit up to battle a renegade killer avatar in a VR game?</p>
